To run tests:
  ghc -ddump-splices Test.hs

This works on template-haskell-2.9.0.0 but not template-haskell-2.10.0.0

Missing features and limitations:
 - 'nameBase' should be part of the default renamer
 - We are limited to a single non-parametric type
 - We don't handle type functions
 - We our variable names are not hygienic
 - We should add a function over Applicative
 - Error checking of input
 - We need better error messages
