Providing users with a way to specify names for generated functions means we
basically need to create a binding form. This is tricky to do in Template
Haskell because any reference to a name gets captured in the current scope.
Non-existent names are errors. We could use a custom quasiquote to get our hands
on the new names without that problem, but then the users will need to be able
to use those names in arbitrary Haskell expressions (which we don't want to try
to parse ourselves). We could use haskell-src-exts and haskell-src-meta to solve
this problem.

Workaround:

var = varE . mkName
foo = [| $(var "x") + 1 |]
